    "- Since we are limited to domain knowledge of diffirent fields and what makes a person likely to default, we will instead concentrate of getting as much info as possible into the final training dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea is that the model will then pick up on which features are important rather than us having to decide that. Basically, our approach is to make as many features as possible and then give them all to the model to use! Later, we can perform feature reduction using the feature importances from the model or other techniques such as PCA. "
